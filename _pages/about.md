About me
======
I am now a fourth-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science under the supervision of Professor [Steve Easterbrook](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~sme/) and Professor [Animesh Garg](https://animesh.garg.tech/). My research mainly focuses on spatiotemporal modeling, especially video prediction, and climate forecasting using deep learning techniques.
