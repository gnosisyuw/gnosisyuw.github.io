About me
======

I'm a final-year Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at the University of Toronto, co-advised by Professors [Steve Easterbrook](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~sme/) and [Animesh Garg](https://animesh.garg.tech/). My research focuses on controllable video generation and world models, drawing inspiration from Bayesian Brain Theory. I study how intelligent agents internalize the rules of their environment by predicting sensory signals—especially vision—to enable planning and interaction. My work explores spatiotemporal modeling using deep learning, with applications in video prediction, climate forecasting, and building pretrained models that understand 3D world dynamics for autonomous exploration. I'm currently open to AI/ML roles in both industry and research.
